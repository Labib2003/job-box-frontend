# Project Description:

This project is an **assignment** of the **Programming Hero Redux Advanced Crash Course**. The frontend ui was provided in a [starter kit](https://github.com/mir-hussain/jobbox-starter). I implemented the backend and the **state management** part in the frontend with `Redux`. The **assignment requirements** are given below.

Live Demo

# Assignment Name:

Employee Management

# Description:

In this task, you will add an extra section to the Jobbox application shown in modules 7, 8, and 9. Feel free to use the starter pack provided previously with the module.

# Tech Stack (Required) :

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- RTQ Query

# Tasks:

### Employer:

- [x] The Employer can see the application count for an open position.
- [x] The employer can close any position at any time.

### Candidate:

- [x] Candidates can filter the "applied job" based on date and approval state.
- [x] Candidates can reply to the direct message, like a **real-time** chat application.

# Note:
- You need to implement user authentication.
- User interactions should be in real time. If there is a need for manual reload after adding or removing data, 5 marks will be deducted.
- All data must be loaded from the server. You can use the Jobbox server (Modify it if you need.) You have to host the server and connect the live link to your application
- You need to keep Redux Dev Tool active. DO NOT DISABLE REACT DEV TOOL (This is important for cross-checking your assignment.)
